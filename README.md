# zk-cryptography

Cryptography & Zero-Knowledge playground in **Rust** and **Solidity** ‚Äî elliptic curves, finite fields, and zk primitives.

This repo is my hands-on space to practice and showcase cryptography fundamentals used in **blockchains** and **zero-knowledge proofs**. 
The goal is to build strong proof-of-work by implementing math + code from scratch and experimenting with ZK-friendly constructs.

## Tech Stack
- **Rust** ‚Üí low-level cryptography implementations (efficient + safe)
- **Solidity** ‚Üí Ethereum smart contracts (on-chain primitives & experiments)
- **Foundry** ‚Üí testing Solidity contracts

## Vision
This repo is meant to grow into:
- A **learning lab** for cryptography + ZK
- A **portfolio of proof-of-work** for security & ZK engineering roles
- A set of **reference implementations** (clean, well-documented, easy to understand)
